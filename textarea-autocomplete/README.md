# Autocomplete in a Textarea
Demos showing how an autocomplete dropdown can be integrated within a textarea (or text input), and be easily leveraged to build:

* A @mention feature where users can easily do references to people (here we are mentionning @actors), places, resources, ...
* A #hashtag feature similar to what you can find on Twitter
* An *'Advanced search UI'*, with dynamic refinements: [see Abacus blogpost](https://blog.algolia.com/algolia-for-realtime-expense-reporting/)

Such kind of user experience are very handy on both Desktop and Mobile website.
